A [GhostText][gt] implementation for the [Thunderbird][tb] email client.

This repo contains an in-development Thunderbird add-on that works as a [GhostText client][protocol] in the mail compose window, so that users can write their emails in their favorite text editor like Vim (provided the text editor already has a GhostText add-on installed).

## Requirements

* [Thunderbird 140][tb] (We will mainly support ESR releases)
* A text editor that has a GhostText server add-on installed and running:

  [![Sublime Text][sublimetext-svg]](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/GhostText)
  [<img width="48" height="48" alt="VSCodium" title="VSCodium" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VSCodium/vscodium.github.io/refs/heads/master/img/codium_cnl.svg" >](https://open-vsx.org/extension/fregante/ghost-text)
  [![Visual Studio Code][vscode-svg]](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fregante.ghost-text)
  [![GNU Emacs][emacs-svg]](https://melpa.org/#/atomic-chrome)
  [![Vim][vim-svg]](https://github.com/raghur/vim-ghost)
  [![Neovim][nvim-svg]](https://github.com/subnut/nvim-ghost.nvim)

  [`$ANY_EDITOR`](https://github.com/newsch/GhostText-Any/)

  The last two implementations can wrap any editor that behaves like Notepad.

## Installation

This add-on is not yet available on [addons.thunderbird.net](https://addons.thunderbird.net/). You can install it manually or build it from source.

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from [Releases][rels].
2. In Thunderbird, go to `Add-ons Manager` and Press :gear: button at the top-right.
3. Select `Install Add-on From File...` from the menu.
4. Select downloaded `.xpi` file.

See [the help page in the Mozilla Support Center](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/installing-addon-thunderbird) for details.

### Build from source

Basically `yarn && yarn build`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

## Usage

1. Launch your favorite text editor.
2. Start GhostText server in your text editor (e.g. with `:GhostTextStart` in Vim).
3. Press the gray Ghostbird button <img src="./ext/gray.svg" width="24" height="24" border="1"> in the Thunderbird mail compose window. (The default shortcut is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd>)
   * If the connection is successful, the button will turn blue <img src="./ext/blue.svg" width="24" height="24" border="1">.
   * If the connection fails, the button will turn red <img src="./ext/red.svg" width="24" height="24" border="1">. Make sure that the GhostText server is listening. See [Troubleshooting page of original GhostText](https://ghosttext.fregante.com/troubleshooting/#unable-to-connect).
4. Write your email in the text editor.
5. Close your text editor to stop Ghostbird.

* Example using Notepad++ via GhostText-Any

## How it works

* See [design.md](./doc/design.md) for details.

### v0.0.1 (Alpha) - Current

* :nest_with_eggs: Prepare the project skeleton (README, build, test, lint, debug, CI)
* :nest_with_eggs: Start button on the toolbar
* :nest_with_eggs: Edit plain text emails
* :nest_with_eggs: Keyboard shortcuts
* :nest_with_eggs: Roadmap and [Project board][proj]

### Help wanted

We need help with:

* [Website](https://exteditor.github.io/ghostbird/) and materials (Please post [screenshots to the wiki](https://github.com/exteditor/ghostbird/wiki/Screenshots))

## FAQ

### Is it safe to use?

* I'd say yes, but save your work frequently since it may contain bugs and eat your email.
* This add-on does not collect any personal data and can only connect to localhost. Attempts to send any data to external servers are blocked by Thunderbird's security model.
* You can look inside the released `.xpi` files (which are just zip files) to verify that it matches the build from the source code.
* As for trustworthiness, the safest option is to wait until it is published on AMO, as that indicates it has passed Mozilla's review process.

### Why not just fork the original GhostText add-on, or contribute to it?

* See [faq.md](./doc/faq.md#why).

### When will it be available on addons.thunderbird.net?

* See [Roadmap](#roadmap) for the planned release schedule.

### How do I set up a development environment?

* See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on the development workflow.

### How do I troubleshoot connection issues?

* Make sure that the GhostText server is listening. See the [Troubleshooting page of original GhostText](https://ghosttext.fregante.com/troubleshooting/#unable-to-connect).

### How do I switch between HTML mode and Plain Text mode?

* See [doc/faq.md](./doc/faq.md#mode).

### How can I support the project?

Please consider the following options:

* [Star the repo](#repository-container-header)
* [Donate to Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/donate/) (It's financially separate from Firefox)
* [Donate to @fregante, the author of the original GhostText](https://github.com/sponsors/fregante)
* [Contribute to the development](#help-wanted)

If you've looked at the options above and still want to motivate the maintainer [@snipsnipsnip](https://github.com/snipsnipsnip) specifically, you can tip some [ETH](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/snipsnipsnip/d0b0bd12045060c8f71fbc9ea936d886/raw/a840747caa6cac61d0bd3b59145e6ed7e9daf14f/eth.json).
