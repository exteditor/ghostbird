# Building

* Ensure that you have Node.js LTS (v22+) and corepack installed.
* Basically, running `make` will do, which is roughly equivalent to `yarn install && yarn build`.
  * A XPI file will appear in `dist/`.
* See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on tools and steps.
* See [building.md](./doc/building.md) for details on build script internals.
