## FAQ (architectural)

### Why do some classes have `static isSingleton` property?

* [`root/startup/startup_*.ts`][startup] scans for classes that have a `static isSingleton` property defined and instantiates them.
* See [About `startup_*.ts`](./design.md#about-startup_ts) for details.

### Instantiate automatically? Doesn't it make the code harder to follow?

* Maybe, but it only automates the `new` calls. Constructors are still explicit about their dependencies.
* You can still search for type names mentioned in constructor parameters.

### Automates the `new`? Don't you lose type safety?

* Yes. We handle this partially by running tests that verify that all dependencies can be instantiated.
  * You can run them by `yarn test sanity`, but `yarn build` also runs them.
  * See [`sanity.test.ts`](../src/test/sanity.test.ts).

### Isn't it a bit hacky to use `static` properties?

* Yes. We might switch to decorators in the future when they become natively supported in Thunderbird.

### How do you find out what classes are instantiated?

* After running `yarn test`, `build/test/dependency_tree.md` is generated, which shows the dependency tree of all classes with `static isSingleton` defined.

### How does automatic instantiation help with maintainability?

* It makes coding less boring by automating a necessary coding task that occurs often: passing objects around to call their methods.
  * I like to think of it as being similar to generating a Makefile. It's not a panacea, but I think it has some effect to extend lifespan of the code until it becomes unmaintainable due to the scale.
* It nudges us to adhere to the [Dependency Inversion Principle][dip].

### How does DIP help with maintainability?

* It nudges us to write code with better testability.
* Testability helps ensure changes (say, to add a feature or adapt to Thunderbird API changes) don't break existing functionality. I sometimes unintentionally introduce such regressions or encounter them.
* It makes it easier to add workarounds and new features without modifying existing code.

### Dependency injection? Isn't DI over-engineered for a small project?

* Maybe, but I intend to maintain this project for a while, and this was the best solution I could devise to adapt to breaking Thunderbird API changes, which seem to [happen every few versions][tbchanges].
* Also, adding DI after the fact tends to be very hard.
* We might drop the autowiring thing and instantiate manually with `new` if the project ends up being stable enough. The practice of initializing everything in `startup.ts` would [still be useful][ploeh], though. It's possible to drop autowiring without [giving up DIP][ploeh2].

### It looks like not using a dependency injection library. Why are you reinventing the wheel?

* I tried some of those available on npm, but I couldn't find one that fits my taste.
* In any case, its use [must be limited][ploeh] to [`root/startup.ts`][startup] (which is one of the requirements that some DI libraries fail to meet).
